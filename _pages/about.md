I am currently a Research Assistant in the Machine Learning Theory Group at Cornell University. I recieved my M.S. in Computer Science from Cornell University (2024) where I was advised by Professor Karthik Sridharan. Prior to this, I recieved my B.A. in Computer Science and Mathematics from Cornell University (2022) under the supervision of Noah Stevens-Davidowitz. 

**Research Interests**

Currently I'm interested in avenues for developing a more practical theory for machine learning. This has taken shape in my current research with projects aiming to answer the following questions:
* **Regression-based Classification:** Are there practical sufficient conditions under which the classification excess risk of a classifier can be bounded by the surrogate loss excess risk of the regression function inducing it? When can we leverage such bounds to reduce learning in more complex paradigms, such as active learning or contextual bandits, to offline regression?
* **Adaptive Bounds for Interactive Decision Making:** Given intuition that the underlying model may have some favorable property, can we design algorithms that achieve model-dependent, adaptive regret boundsâ€”performing better on problem instances that align with this intuition while maintaining strong worst-case guarantees?

More broadly, I am interested in uncovering the theoretical foundations of machine learning.
