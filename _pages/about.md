I am currently a Research Assistant in the Machine Learning Theory Group at Cornell University. I recieved my M.S. in Computer Science from Cornell University (2024) where I was advised by Professor Karthik Sridharan. Prior to this, I recieved my B.A. in Computer Science and Mathematics from Cornell University (2022) under the supervision of Noah Stevens-Davidowitz. 

**Research Interests**
--
Currently I'm interested in avenues for developing a more practical theory for machine learning. This has taken shape in my research with my projects aiming to answer the following questions:
* **Agnostic Active Learning:** Under what practical assumptions (on the data generation process and the benchmark model class) can we create efficient and accurate active learning algorithms?
* **Adaptive Bounds for Interactive Decision Making:** Can algorhtms achieve model-dependent adaptive regret bounds for interactive decision making that do not compromise on worst-case problem instances?

More broadly, I have a strong interest in uncovering the theoretical foundations of machine learning.
