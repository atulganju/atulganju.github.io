* **Agnostic Active Learning via Offline Regression** (with Shashaank Aiyer, Karthik Sridharan, and Ved Sriraman)\
  planning submission for ICML 2025\
  [[Writeup](https://github.com/atulganju/Agnostic-Stream-Based-Selective-Sampling-via-Regression)]\
  We develop the first efficient algorithm for online active learning with performance guarantees when the problem instance is not realizable. In particular, we found that (1) offline binary classification reduces to offline regression with squared error whenever the benchmark function class is convex and (2) we can leverage this result to develop an efficient epoch-based algorithm for online active learning which provably works under significantly milder assumptions on the data distribution and benchmark function class than realizability.
