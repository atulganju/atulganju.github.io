* **Agnostic Active Learning via Offline Regression** (with Shashaank Aiyer, Karthik Sridharan, and Ved Sriraman)\
  *planning submission for ICML 2025*\
  [[Writeup](https://github.com/atulganju/Agnostic-Stream-Based-Selective-Sampling-via-Regression)]\
  We develop the first efficient algorithm for online active learning with performance guarantees when the problem instance is not realizable. In particular, we found that (1) offline binary classification reduces to offline regression with squared error whenever the benchmark function class is convex and (2) we can leverage this result to develop an efficient epoch-based algorithm for online active learning which provably works under significantly milder assumptions on the data distribution and benchmark function class than realizability.

* **Adaptive Rates for Interactive Decision Making** (with Karthik Sridharan)\

  We develop the a framework for constructing algorithms that attain adaptive regret bounds for a general class of interactive decision making problems. In particular, we found that (1) offline binary classification reduces to offline regression with squared error whenever the benchmark function class is convex and (2) we can leverage this result to develop an efficient epoch-based algorithm for online active learning which provably works under significantly milder assumptions on the data distribution and benchmark function class than realizability.

* **A Framework for Simple and Complex Contagion on Clustered Networks and its Implications**\
  [[Writeup](https://github.com/atulganju/Complex-Contagion-In-Clique-Based-Networks/tree/main)]
  I develop the first framework for analyzing complex contagion on a rich class of networks with varying local structure. Inspired by several experimental results which suggest that the diffusion of behavior across social networks is a complex contagion process, I use this framework to understand how the local structure of a network can influence complex contagion dynamics. Specifically, I develop a framework for modeling the final fraction of nodes in a network that adopt a contagion.
