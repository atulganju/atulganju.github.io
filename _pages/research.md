* **Agnostic Active Learning via Offline Regression** (with Shashaank Aiyer, Karthik Sridharan, and Ved Sriraman)\
  *planning submission for ICML 2025*\
  [[Writeup](https://github.com/atulganju/Agnostic-Stream-Based-Selective-Sampling-via-Regression)]\
  We develop the first efficient algorithm for online active learning with performance guarantees when the problem instance is not realizable. In particular, we found that (1) offline binary classification reduces to offline regression with squared error whenever the benchmark function class is convex and (2) we can leverage this result to develop an efficient epoch-based algorithm for online active learning which provably works under significantly milder assumptions on the data distribution and benchmark function class than realizability.

  We develop the a framework for constructing algorithms that attain adaptive regret bounds for a general class of interactive decision making problems. In particular, we found that (1) offline binary classification reduces to offline regression with squared error whenever the benchmark function class is convex and (2) we can leverage this result to develop an efficient epoch-based algorithm for online active learning which provably works under significantly milder assumptions on the data distribution and benchmark function class than realizability.

* **A Framework for Simple and Complex Contagion on Clustered Networks and its Implications**\
  [[Writeup](https://github.com/atulganju/Complex-Contagion-In-Clique-Based-Networks/tree/main)]
  Inspired by several experimental results which suggest that the diffusion of behavior across social networks is a complex contagion process, we develop the first analytic framework for modeling complex contagion on a rich class of networks with varying local structure. Specifically, this framework models the final fraction of nodes in these network that adopt a contagion. Extensive experimental results validate the accuracy of the mathematical models for adoption generated by our framework and enabled us to provide answers to the following questions. How does a network's local structure influence contagion dynamics? Do the propensities the nodes of a network have towards adoption of a contagion dictate the types of networks in which the contagion is more likely to spread? How the initial fraction of nodes starting with a contagion effect the likelihood of a global cascade?
